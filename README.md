# What is the project about
  - Construction of a fraud detector in bank transactions. 
    - Using the structure of a data science project from data collection to cross validation of the chosen final model.

# Difficulties found
  - The problem of lack of positive examples in the data set, where the classifier ended up classifying the examples as false positives, was solved with a randomly controlled data set balancing technique
